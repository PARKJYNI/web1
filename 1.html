  <strong><u>Manchester City</u> Football Club</strong> is an English football club based in Manchester that competes in <a href="https://www.premierleague.com" target="_blank" title="premierleague site">the Premier League</a>, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. <p>The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. The club adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894 in the first season of the club's current iteration, that have been used ever since. They are currently ranked 6th in the all-time English top flight table since its creation in 1888, thus making it one of the country's most successful football clubs.

  </p><p style="margin-top:40px">Manchester City entered the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in 1904. The club had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, European Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in its history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001â€“02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002-03.</p>
